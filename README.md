# 📢 Meta Ads Campaign for JioMart - Catalogue

## 🛍 Project Overview
This project documents the complete setup of a **Meta (Facebook & Instagram) Ads campaign** for **JioMart** using the **Catalogue Ad format**.  
I managed the entire process — from campaign strategy and targeting to budget planning, product catalogue creation, and ad creative design.

## 🎯 Campaign Objective
**Objective Chosen:** Sales (Conversions)  

I selected the **Sales (Conversions)** objective because JioMart’s primary goal is to drive online purchases and increase revenue.  
This objective optimizes delivery to reach users most likely to complete a purchase, ensuring high-quality leads.  

The **Catalogue Ad format** was chosen to allow users to browse multiple products directly within the ad, reducing friction in the shopping journey.  
The campaign destination was set to **JioMart’s website**, enabling a seamless transaction process.

## 📌 Performance Goal & Budget
- **Performance Goal:** Maximize Number of Conversions  
  Focused on targeting high-intent users to maximize purchase volume.  

- **Budget:** ₹200/day for 7 days (**Total ₹1,400**)  
  A daily budget ensures steady ad delivery, allows for algorithm optimization, and reaches a broad audience over time.  
  This setup is cost-effective for testing campaign performance while meeting JioMart’s goal of increasing online orders.
